# Picture-in-Picture
Javascript project for making the picture in picture effect. Picture in picture allows you to see 2 screens at the same time at the same monitor. So for example if you want to watch a video and read a website page at the same time you can minimize the video in a way its still visible while your reading the website page so that you can see both.
